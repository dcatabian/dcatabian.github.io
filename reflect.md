REFLECTION:

 - in truth, implementation wasn't difficult
 - game's premise was already simple enough, the art direction made it easier
   to get away with simpler art and animation
 - perhaps I could have gone with a more complex game, but I think the finished product
   exceeded my expectations for how fun it is, so I don't regret it.
   
 - this is the first time I've used a generator function in java
 - Otherwise I would have used a while true loop and that would have been much messier
 - There's likely an even better way to run the input interactions than I have implemented,
   declaring the game loop only to initialize it later seems like a hack
 - but having an async generator function running the game loop definitely makes me feel smart
 
 - also proud I didn't need gpt or copilot
 - In designing the game for assignment 2, implementation methodology was 
   a big part of deciding on a concept
 - I mean this beyond pseudocode: was already set on some sort of asynchronous
   game loop function that would control it
 - that, coupled with asynchronous javascript experience, contributed the most in
   making the implementation easy
